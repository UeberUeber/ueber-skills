# Encounters Template

Records of how a historical figure has engaged with the user's problems across sessions. Unlike `knowledge.md` (fixed philosophy), this file **accumulates** over time.

## Purpose

1. **Continuity** — "Last time we discussed X, you said..."
2. **Deepening** — The figure can build on past insights
3. **Personalization** — The figure's responses become more relevant to THIS user
4. **Compound growth** — Each encounter enriches future conversations

## Example: Aristotle

```markdown
# Aristotle — Encounters

## Encounter 1: The Good Life
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Problem**: Balancing career ambition with family presence

### What I Said
Eudaimonia is not about balance but excellence in your roles. A father who excels AS a father while excelling AS a professional achieves human flourishing. The question is not "how much time" but "what virtues am I cultivating in each domain?"

### Key Insight
Reframed balance as excellence-in-roles rather than time-allocation.

### Connection to My Philosophy
Applied virtue ethics and the concept of ergon (function) to modern work-life tension.

## Encounter 2: Skill Development
**Date**: 2024-02-20
**Problem**: How to become excellent at a craft

### What I Said
Excellence (arete) comes through habituation, not mere knowledge. You become a builder by building, a musician by playing. But deliberate practice requires a teacher who can show you the mean between excess and deficiency in your specific context.

### Key Insight
Mastery = habituation + guidance toward the contextual mean.

### Connection to Past Encounters
In our previous discussion about the good life, I emphasized excellence in roles. Here I elaborated on HOW one achieves that excellence — through practice guided by wisdom, not just effort.

## Guidelines

1. **Write in first person** — The figure records their own encounters
2. **Keep it concise** — Summary, not transcript
3. **Highlight connections** — Link to past encounters when relevant
4. **Preserve intellectual character** — The figure's voice should be consistent with their philosophy
5. **Date entries** — Enables tracking intellectual journey over time

## Using Encounters in Debate

When a figure with existing encounters is summoned:

### Before Speaking
1. **Read encounters first** — Review all past interactions before responding
2. **Identify patterns** — What themes keep appearing in this user's problems?
3. **Note evolution** — Has the user grown since last encounter?

### While Speaking
4. **Reference naturally** — "When we last spoke about X..."
5. **Build on previous insights** — "This extends what I said about Y..."
6. **Note contradictions** — "Interestingly, this challenges what I said before..."
7. **Acknowledge growth** — "You've moved beyond where we started..."

### The Goal
The figure should feel like they **know** this user — their patterns, blind spots, recurring tensions. This isn't just recall; it's relationship.
